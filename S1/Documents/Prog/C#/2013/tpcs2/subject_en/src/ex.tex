\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Before you start}
While doing these exercises you will often be asked to display text on the console,
without any other indication you have to add a new line at the end of every exercise.\\
You will also notice that if you run your program in Visual Studio,
it will spawn and disapear before you can do anything.
To fix this problem, you can either add a call to \codeil{Console.Read()} at the end of your \codeil{Main} in
order to wait for some user input, or simply launch your program from a console.\\

It is now time to start the real work, that is creating a new console project in Visual Studio
by selecting File/New/Project/Console Application with "tpcs02" as a name and going on
with the following exercises!
