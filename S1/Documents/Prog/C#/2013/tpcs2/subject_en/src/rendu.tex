\section{Hand in instructions}

At the end of this practical work, you will have to hand in an archive file following these instructions:\\

\begin{lstlisting}
rendu-tpcs2-login_x.zip
|-- rendu-tpcs2-login_x/
    |-- AUTHORS
    |-- tpcs2.sln
    |-- tpcs2
        |-- Everything except bin/ et obj/
\end{lstlisting}
\bigskip

Of course you have to replace "\texttt{login\_x}" with your own
login.\\

Don't forget to check the following items before handing in:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{AUTHORS} must follow the usual format (a *, a
  space, your login and a newline character).
  \item No \texttt{bin} or \texttt{obj} directories in the project.
  \item \textbf{The code must compile!}
\end{itemize}
