\subsection{Exercise 4: MCQte}

Write the \codeil{QCM} function that asks the user a question and prints:\\
- "Good job bro!" if the answer is right.\\
- "You lose... The answer was X." if the answer is wrong, replacing X by
the number of the right answer.\\
- "So counting is too hard, n00b..." if the input is invalid.\\
The \codeil{ansX} options only contain the text of the answer, it is your job to
print the "X) " at the beginning of each one.\\
The \codeil{answer} parameter contains the number of the right answer.\\
Do not handle the cases in which the user doesn't type a number.\\
PROTIP: to concatenate two strings you can use the operator \codeil{+}.\\

Prototype:
\begin{code}
static void QCM(string question,
                string ans1,
                string ans2,
                string ans3,
                string ans4,
                int answer)
\end{code}

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
> test_QCM.exe
What's the difference between a pigeon ?
1) The legs, especially the left one
2) Yes
3) Obiwan Kenobi
4) The D answer
2
You lose... The answer was 1.
\end{verbatim}

Bonus: handle incorrect input (search how to use \codeil{try \ldots{} catch}).
