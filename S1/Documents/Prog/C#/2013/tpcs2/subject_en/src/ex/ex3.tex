\subsection{Exercise 3: Triforce}

Write the \codeil{Triforce} function that prints a triforce in yellow on a blue background
and changes the title to "Triforce".\\
You must also call \codeil{Console.ResetColor()} at the end to reset the console to its normal state.\\
PROTIP: these changes are not done through function calls but by modifying the \codeil{Console} properties
(look for "Console Class" on MSDN).
Also search for \codeil{ConsoleColor}.\\

Prototype:
\begin{code}
static void Triforce()
\end{code}

Example:
\begin{verbatim}
> test_triforce.exe
   /\
  /__\
 /\  /\
/__\/__\
\end{verbatim}

Bonus: Use only one \codeil{Write}, because one line is better.
